## 🚀 About the Project

This is a Verilog-based implementation of a 32-bit RISC-V processor supporting the RV32I instruction set architecture with extensions for cryptographic and bit-manipulation operations. The processor is designed with a classic 5-stage pipeline and includes **4 custom instructions** to accelerate SHA-3 hashing.

### Key Highlights:
- **71 standard RISC-V instructions** implemented (RV32I subset)
- **4 custom SHA-3 instructions**:
  - Accelerate `XOR5` operation and 64-bit word rotation — key components of the SHA-3 algorithm
  - Achieve a **2.68× speedup** over using only Zkn/Zks cryptographic extensions for SHA-3 block processing
- **Single-core, 5-stage pipelined processor**
- **Written entirely in Verilog HDL**

### Instruction Support:
- **Standard ISA:** RV32I (Unprivileged subset)
- **Not implemented:** CSR, `FENCE`, `FENCE.I`, `ECALL`, `EBREAK`, Privileged ISA
- **Extensions:**
  - **K Extension** – Experimental support for Zkn and Zks (Bit-manipulation and cryptographic instructions)
  - **Custom SHA-3 instructions**

## 🛠️ ASIC Implementation

The RTL design has been synthesized and taken through a complete ASIC physical design flow using **Cadence® tools** on a **45nm technology node**, under multiple operating conditions.

### Implementation Details:
- **Design Flow:** Semi-custom ASIC flow  
- **Tools:** Industry-standard Cadence® toolchain  
- **Technology:** 45nm slow and fast libraries  
- **Clock Frequency:** Evaluated at multiple operating frequencies, including 100 MHz  
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Area, Power, Timing, and Delay reports generated post-synthesis  
  - At 100 MHz, **minimum power consumption recorded: 915.860 μW**
